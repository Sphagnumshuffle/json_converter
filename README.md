# json_converter
JSON converter converts JSON input into readable output. In this example takes an input json-file that contains restaurant opening hours for every day. Jupyter notebook in this repo demonstrates how the converter deals with JSON data and converts it into reasonable output. 

## JSON strucure
Keys are days and values are opening hours in unix time. I convert them into 12 hour time
