# json_converter

JSON converter converts JSON input into readable output. In this example takes an input json-file that contains restaurant opening hours for every day. Jupyter notebook in this repo demonstrates how the converter deals with JSON data and converts it into reasonable output.

## JSON strucure

Keys are days and values are opening hours in unix time. I convert them into 12 hour time

## How to use/test

Feel free to download this repo and all it's contents and test out locally on your computer. This repo is public so feel free to do what you want with it. This particular notebook doesn't handle edgecases sophisticated yet. But it gets the work done based on the restaurant.json that is testable json in the folder. I did this in kind of haste and it is only first iteration so give me some mercy guys!
